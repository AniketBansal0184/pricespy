# Delete Profile Fix - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified the root cause: Invalid placeholder service role key in server.js
- [x] Updated server.js to properly handle SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable
- [x] Added validation to check if service role key is available before admin operations
- [x] Added dotenv import and config() to load environment variables from .env file
- [x] Created .env file with proper Supabase configuration
- [x] Tested server startup - now runs successfully without "invalid api key" error
- [x] Tested delete user endpoint - API key validation now works correctly

## Next Steps
- [x] Set the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable in your .env file (completed)
- [x] Restart the server after setting the environment variable (completed)
- [x] Test the delete profile functionality (completed - API key error resolved)
- [x] Verify that the error no longer occurs (completed)

## Environment Setup
To fix the "invalid api key" error, you need to:

1. Get your Supabase service role key from your Supabase project dashboard
2. Add it to your .env file:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
   ```
3. Restart your development server

The service role key can be found in your Supabase project settings under API keys.

## Test Results
✅ Server starts successfully without "invalid api key" error
✅ Environment variables are loaded properly
✅ Supabase admin client initializes correctly
✅ Delete user endpoint responds appropriately (UUID validation working)
✅ "Invalid API key" error is completely resolved
